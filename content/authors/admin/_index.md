Welcome to my website. Here you can find out a little bit about me - my professional past, current activities, and future aspirations. 

I am a professional data engineer and software developer with current concentration in interactive visualizations and database setup. Currently, I am a senior data analyst at the Taxi & Limousine Commission of the New York City. My work involves developing and automating big data processes, building and interacting with databases, creating apps and dashboards for TLC and public, as well as conducting high level research to empower impactful legislation in the area of city transportation. I am also a co-founder of VeryCool Studio - an app development, data analysis, and rapid prototyping company (http://www.verycool-studio.com). In my spare time I like to play beach volleyball, watch soccer and documentaries, and code a bit more. 

This website will provide you with some examples of my work as well as my contact information. I will try to keep this site as current as possible and will be adding more content as it comes.
