abstract: Navigating New York’s Open Data portals may sometimes feel like drowning in a pool of meaningless numbers, but a new tool launched by New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission is attempting to change that. The TLC Data Hub was unveiled on Thursday, featuring data from for-hire vehicles, yellow taxis, green taxis, and other shared rides across the city. The tool allows users to visualize data points like average daily rides, length of rides, and which neighborhoods are seeing the most pick-ups or drop-offs.
